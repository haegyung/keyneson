This repository houses a q-study on taxation and the economy.

It was first developed for, and used as part of [Maximilian Held's](http://www.maxheld.de) [dissertation](http://www.maxheld.de/schumpeter) on taxation and democracy, and was administered before and after [Civicon](http://www.civicon.de) Citizen Conferences on the topic.

Any given iteration of this study is defined by pointers to (versions of) of three submodules:

1. `keyneson-concourse`, the complete set of q items
2. `keyneson-sample`, the sampling method or structure by which to sample from 1)
3. `keyneson-data`, the raw data gathered by q-sorts as per 1) and 2).

Further analyses can be found in here.
